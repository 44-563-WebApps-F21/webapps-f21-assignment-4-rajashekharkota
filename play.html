            sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.</p>
    </h6>
    <p>LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form
    of tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the
    strong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.<br>

    GERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.<br>

    GERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.<br>

    GERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.<br>

    GERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good
    at once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,
    and usually in wild revolt against herself.<br>

    GERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they
    are curious.  Both are disappointed.<br>

    GERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,
    my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.<br>

    GERALD.  But if one is in love?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one
    should never marry.<br>

    GERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?<br>

    LORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.
    And one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a
    romance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.
    It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one
    use of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation
    of us Harfords.</p>
