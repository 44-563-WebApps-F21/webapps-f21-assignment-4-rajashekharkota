     <h5 class="GERALD">GERALD.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">[_Shakes her fan at him_.]</p> <p class="speech">I don’t know how it is,
     dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me
     excessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.</p>

     <h5 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5> <p class="speech">All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is
     destruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives
     being thought of.</p>

     <h5 class="GERALD">GERALD.</h5> <p class="speech"> I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I
     have no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.
     I don’t believe in womenthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should doall things in moderation.</p>

     <h5 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH. </h5> <p class="speech">Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing
     succeeds like excess.</p>

     <h5 class="GERALD">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable
     maxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.</p>
